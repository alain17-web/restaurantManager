This component represents the tablet a waiter might have to take orders. it is used on the Restaurant page. Since this app is for demo purposes only, instead of having an actual order form, the component uses a function ( from utils directory ) that picks a random number of people as well as a matching number of random dishes and drinks from the menu. This function is called when the button new order is clicked. That causes a 2-part mui-Accordion to appear. The top part of the Accordion is visible by default and displays the "ordered" (actually randomly selected ) dishes and desserts. The bottom part can be opened by clicking an arrow on the Accordion and displays the selected drinks. Clicking the Validate button under the Accordion will cause the order to be sent to the server (and thus be visible in ListOrders in the dashboard as well as in the Notepad component on the Kitchen page) and will restore the initial state of the component.
