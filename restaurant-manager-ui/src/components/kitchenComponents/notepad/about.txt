This component is used on the Kitchen page and is designed to display the latest order (only the dishes - not the drinks ) made by the waiter ( on the Restaurant page ). It has a button allowing the user to validate the order, which will in turn update the stock ( by substracting the number of dishes fom the stock ) and the finances ( by adding the worth of the dishes to the available funds ).
