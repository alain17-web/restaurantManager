This component uses a mui-dataGrid to display data about current active staff as well an edit icon. It is called in the ListActiveStaff page in the dashboard ( only authorized users ). As a precaution, it is not possible to delete active staff. It is only possible to change their status to inactive - which will cause them to appear on the DataTaleInactive component where it is then possible to delete them.
Both DataTableActive and DataTableInactive components fetch the data from a table employees in the database. In this component, only the employees with an active status are shown
