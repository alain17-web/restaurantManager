This component uses a mui-dataGrid to display data about current inactive staff as well edit and delete icons. It is called in the ListInactiveStaff page in the dashboard ( only authorized users ). As a precaution, it is not possible to delete active staff. It is only possible to change their status to inactive - which will cause them to appear on the DataTaleInactive component where it is then possible to delete them.
Both DataTableActive and DataTableInactive components fetch the data from a table employees in the database. In this component, only the employees with an inactive status are shown.
