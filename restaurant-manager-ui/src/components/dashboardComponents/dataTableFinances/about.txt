This component uses a mui-dataGrid to display data about the financial situation including the current amount of funds available. A new financial report is created when an order is validated by the kitchen and when a new purchase is received (deliver date no longer pending). Each report updates the total amount available. It also displays see detail and delete icons and is called in the ListFinances page in the dashboard.
