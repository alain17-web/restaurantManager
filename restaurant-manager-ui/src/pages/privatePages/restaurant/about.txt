This page is only accessible to a logged in user ( either as a guest or restaurant staff ). It represents the restaurant and contains the NewOrder ( representing the tablet used by the waiter to take the orders ) component where all the logic to display and validate the new orders is found. The Restaurant page itself is mostly decorative. As most public pages as well the Kitchen page, it has one single background image easily changeable if one wants to modify the atmosphere of the visual aspect of the app depending on the type of restaurant ( middle eastern food, japanese food, indian,...).
