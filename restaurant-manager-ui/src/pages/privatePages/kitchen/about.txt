This page is only accessible to a logged in user ( either as a guest or kitchen staff ). It represents the kitchen and contains the Notepad component where all the logic to display and validate the received orders is found. The Kitchen page itself is mostly decorative. As most public pages as well the Restaurant page, it has one single background image easily changeable if one wants to modify the atmosphere of the visual aspect of the app depending on the type of restaurant ( middle eastern food, japanese food, indian,...).
